# An Object that changed my life


One thing that most probably had a very positive influence on my life was
getting access to Wikipedia. 

It is baffaling how much knowledge of the world has been gathered in the short time since the inception of Wikipedia. 
Niche themes such as the border conflict of Indonesia and Timor Leste, an exhaustive account on various mystical creatures from norse mythology, instances of municipal republicanism in the Holy Roman Empire. But its not just niche themes, you can also follow the news through Wikipedia without much of a loss of stylistic quality or journalistic neutrality. 

I guess I have always been curious growing up but my thirst for knowledge used to be moderated by not having access to books about every topic on the world.

Also Wikipedia has the advantage over books of being Hypertext. In every Text there are links to every other topic mentioned in the Text.

The Workflow of discovering new topics differs significantly between reading a Wikipedia Text or a Book. 

Reading a book it might be as follows:
One reads a text about one topic. One discovers the existence of a different related topic. One loses interest in the first topic and starts obsessing about the second topic. The Text one reads is still about the first topic. One loses interest and stops reading.

Reading a Wikipedia Text might be as follows:
One reads a text about one topic. One discovers the existence of a different related topic. One loses interest in the first topic and starts obsessing about the second topic. One clicks on the link to the text about the second topic. One enjoys limitless knowledge.
