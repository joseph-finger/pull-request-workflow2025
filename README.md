# pull-request-workflow2025
This is a repo for students to try the pull request approach

The aim of this project is to familiarize yourselves with the Github pull-request-based workflow. In the appendix of the Git slides, you will find screenshots how to fork or to do a pull-request.

## Selection of 2 maintainers

The role of the maintainers is to allow contributions to get in. They will get the right to merge everything.

## Reviewers

The role of the reviewers is to comment on the submission of others. They do not have the right to merge, but they should comment to keep the quality high.

## Submission

The submission itself go in two parts:
  - first you submit a draft pull-request. This should only contain the structure
  - the maintainer will design one reviewer. The reviewer should comment on the text.
  - finally you should submit the final pull-request.
  - in the first revision of the pull-request, forget the licence. The reviewers will remind you and you should rebase the commits with the license in the first commit and update the pull-request accordingly.

## Task

Finally the task is simple: write an introduction about something positive. Some examples include:
  - a object / animal that changed your life and you would recommend to anyone else
  - some idea on how to improve one exercise of the missing semester
